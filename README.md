## About Lawoole

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Lawoole framework. If you want to build an application using Lawoole, visit the main [Lawoole repository](https://github.com/lawoole/lawoole).

Lawoole is a high-performance PHP framework based on Laravel and Swoole.

Laravel is the most popular PHP framework. It is dedicated to helping developers write the most elegant and meaningful code, and also provides a wealth of functions to developers through the ecological chain.

As we all know, Laravel's biggest flaw is the performance problems behind its rich features. Lawoole was born to solve this problem.
By using Swoole as an infrastructure, it not only enhances the efficiency of network communication, but also avoids the consumption of repeated compilation. At the same time, Lawoole did not sacrifice the outstanding features of Laravel. In Lawoole, you can have a development experience consistent with Laravel and write creative code.

Lawoole is different from other Swoole-based frameworks in that it does not seek performance, but rather seeks a balance between a comfortable code writing environment and the efficiency of program execution. Lawoole does not admire those who sacrificed code readability and wrote hard-to-maintain and error-prone code.

Thank for the shoulders of giants:

- Laravel ( [https://laravel.com](https://laravel.com) )
- Swoole ( [https://www.swoole.com](https://www.swoole.com) )
